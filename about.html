        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            Kilovolt Engineering, founded in 2021 and headquartered in Warner Robins, Georgia, specializes in all facets of distribution engineering up to 25 kV. What sets us apart from other engineering firms is our hands-on field experience and deep understanding of real-world electrical challenges. Our team, endowed with three decades of combined industry expertise, is uniquely positioned to provide technically rigorous, practical solutions tailored to the specific needs of each client.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Our founders bring together an exceptional 30 years of expertise in the power industry, specializing in aspects like Medium Voltage (MV) planning and design, electrical troubleshooting, coordination of protective devices, sectionalizing studies, and field inspections. Our first-hand knowledge, gained through years of field experience as linemen and engineers, uniquely positions us to offer technically rigorous, practical solutions for the complex electrical challenges faced by our clients.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            In our project portfolio, we have successfully completed several USDA RUS work plans for rural utilities, the most recent of which was valued at approximately \$100 million. Our day-to-day responsibilities often include managing engineering operations for a large cooperative, with a network that consists of over 50 substations and more than 200 circuits. Within this scope, we coordinate a comprehensive suite of protection devices, such as substation breakers, Distribution Automation Devices (DADs), line reclosers, tripsavers, and fuses.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            We are also proficient in designing and sizing distribution infrastructure, including transformers and medium- and low-voltage conductors. Our capabilities extend to planning new power lines, troubleshooting field issues, and resolving radio frequency interference (RFI) typically caused by deteriorated insulators and surge arrestors.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Our mission is to provide engineering solutions that stand up to the highest industry standards for quality and reliability. We are dedicated to solving the complex engineering challenges that our clients face, and we welcome the opportunity to demonstrate our commitment to engineering excellence on your next project.
